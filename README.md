# azure-serverless-with-blazor

we will learn how to implement Azure serverless with Blazor web assembly. We will create an app that lists out some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on Covid-19. We will create an Azure Cosmos DB which will act as our primary database to store questions and answers. An Azure function app will be used to fetch data from cosmos DB. We will deploy the function app to Azure to expose it globally via an API endpoint. We will consume the API in a Blazor web assembly app. The FAQs will be displayed in a card layout with the help of Bootstrap.
